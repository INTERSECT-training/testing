<h1> what is testing?</h1>
Software testing involves the process of executing the software to discover any discrepencies between the expect behavior and the actual behavior of the software. Therefore the goal of software testing is to uncover defects, bugs, or errors in the software, making it more reliable, stable, and usable. Testing is the most widely used technique for the quality assuarance of software. However, testing cannot prove that a software is correct, unless you execute the software with all the possible inputs and verify that th produced outputs are correct accoriding to the expected behavior. Obviously this is not practical. Thus the focus of testing is to executed the software with a set of "good" inputs and verify the produced outputs are correct, and there by improving the confidance about the program. Therefore, testing typically involves the following activities.
1. Test input design.
2. Test execution.
3. Checking the correctness of test outputs.
