# pytest: A test framework
While it is not practical to test a program with all possible inputs we should execute mutiple tests that exercise differnt aspects of the program. Thus, to ease this process we use *test frameworks*. It is simply a software tool or library that provides a structured and organized environment for designing, writing, and executing tests. Here we will be using **[pytest]** (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/index.html), which is a widely used testing framework for Python.

Follow the instructions [here] (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/getting-started.html) to install pytest if you haven't done so already.
